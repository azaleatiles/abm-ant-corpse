# abm-ant-corpse

This is a simple agent based model implemented in Java. There is a main applet class (ABMApplet) which you can run in an IDE, or in a webpage if you're keen to set one up.

You can modify properties of the model in ABMApplet - things like size of environment and number of ants, corpses etc. No fancy property files - it's just set in the applet class definition directly.

You can modify ant behaviours in the Ant class. Or just use the defaults.

It's only very simple - my first implementation of an agent based model.

Enjoy!
