# agent-based-model

This is a simple agent based model implemented in Java. It models corpse clustering behaviours in ants, inspired by "Swarm Intelligence" by SantaFe Press.

There is a main applet class (ABMApplet) which you can run in an IDE. You can modify properties of the model in ABMApplet - things like size of environment and number of ants, corpses etc. You can modify ant behaviours in the Ant class. Or just use the defaults.
